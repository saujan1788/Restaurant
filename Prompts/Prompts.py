def Initial_Prompts:
    Help me create a EC2 instance and then install ansible, git, terrraform. After that add my remote repo as a remote origin and sync my data.

def Network_Prompts:
    I have an EC2 instance, I want to use terraform to create different networks for a restaurant based microservice application where I will have multiple microservices , I want them to talk with the DB I want to create different subnets for each use case , I want to do this using terraform.

    This instance is in AWS so do I have to provide my access keys for it to be able to create resources in my AWS account and do i need to give the region info
